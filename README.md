# Kayla Backus - Portfolio

## Description
This is my first portfolio. I plan to add projects to it in the future when I have more to share.

One issue that I faced in this project was correctly using flexbox properties on the elements in the codeâ€”particularly on the second and third projects in the My Work section. I eventually figured out that I had to put each project in its own div in order to get the projects where I wanted them on the page. In addition to practicing flexbox, this reiterated the CSS Box Model for me. The items on the page are in their own "boxes."

In the future, I want to create a pseudo class where when you hover over a project, the image turns from grayscale to color. I also want to add shadows to the images on the page.
